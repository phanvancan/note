**Proxy Config Format:**

`proxy_http=username:password@proxy-host:port`

### Single User Temporary Settings

When you do not need to force the system to be under the proxy.

1. Open a Terminal window where you need proxy access.
2. Set and export the HTTP_PROXY variable.

    `export HTTP_PROXY=user:pass@my.proxy.server:8080`

3. Set and export the HTTPS_PROXY variable.

    `export HTTPS_PROXY=user:pass@my.proxy.server:8081`

4. Set and export the NO_PROXY variable to prevent local traffic from being sent to the proxy.

    `export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,*.my.lan.domain`

### Single User Persistent Proxy Settings

1. Open your bash profile file into a text editor. If you use other terminals like zsh, open their specific file, in case zsh would be `~/.zshrc`.

    `vi ~/.bash_profile`

2. Add the following lines, modifying them to match your environment.

    ```
    export http_proxy=username:password@proxyhost.com:8080
    export https_proxy=username:password@proxyhost.com:8081
    exprot no_proxy=localhost, 127.0.0.1, *.my.lan
    ```

3. Save your settings.
4. The proxy settings will be applied the next time you start a session, by logging into the server or opening a new Terminal window from a Desktop.
5. To force apply your new proxy settings in the current Terminal session, execute the source command against your bash profile.

    `source ~/.bash_profile`

### All Users

1. Using an administrator account, open `/etc/environment` into a text editor.

    `sudo vi /etc/environment`

2. Add the following lines, modifying them to fit your environment. Username and password may be omitted, if not required.

    ```
    http_proxy="http://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/"
    https_proxy="http://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/"
    ftp_proxy="http://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/"
    no_proxy="<pattern>,<pattern>,...
    ```

    For example, if you do not need to enter a username or password, and your proxy server is my.proxyserver.net at port 8080, and you do not want local traffic going through the proxy, you would enter the following:

    ```
    http_proxy="http://my.proxyserver.net:8080/"
    https_proxy="http://my.proxyserver.net:8080/"
    ftp_proxy="http://my.proxyserver.net:8080/"
    no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,::1
    ```

3. Save your changes and exit the text editor.
